          <p class="text-gray-600">
            A good pitch includes your team background, the problem you're solving, your solution and technology, market size, competitive landscape, traction to date, and your funding needs and plans for using the capital.

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Our investment process typically takes 4-6 weeks from initial meeting to funding decision. For companies with urgent capital needs, we can sometimes accelerate this timeline.
